The regular expression shall be matched against the sample text and the matches, 
including groups and indexes of start and end characters within the sample text,
shall be presented.

The shown sample UI shall give you an idea how to structure the HMI of 
the application using JavaFX Controls.   
You may design and style your application as you wish as long the required
features are supported. E.g. the 'Matches' text area could be replaced by
something more advanced, such as a list (ListView) or table (TableView).
